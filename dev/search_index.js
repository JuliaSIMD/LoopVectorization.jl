The integer's value indicates the number of threads to use. It is clamped to be between 1 and min(Threads.nthreads(),LoopVectorization.num_cores()). false is equivalent to 1, and true is equivalent to min(Threads.nthreads(),LoopVectorization.num_cores()).\n\nsafe (defaults to true) will cause @turbo to fall back to @inbounds @fastmath if can_turbo returns false for any of the functions called in the loop. You can disable the associated warning with warn_check_args=false.\n\nSetting the keyword argument warn_check_args=true (e.g. @turbo warn_check_args=true for ...) in a loop or broadcast statement will cause it to warn once if LoopVectorization.check_args fails and the fallback loop is executed instead of the LoopVectorization-optimized loop. Setting it to an integer > 0 will warn that many times, while setting it to a negative integer will warn an unlimited amount of times. The default is warn_check_args = 1. Failure means that there may have been an array with unsupported type, unsupported element types, or (if safe=true) a function for which can_turbo returned false.\n\ninline is a Boolean. When true, body will be directly inlined into the function (via a forced-inlining call to _turbo_!). When false, it wont force inlining of the call to _turbo_! instead, letting Julia's own inlining engine determine whether the call to _turbo_! should be inlined. (Typically, it won't.) Sometimes not inlining can lead to substantially worse code generation, and >40% regressions, even in very large problems (2-d convolutions are a case where this has been observed). One can find some circumstances where inline=true is faster, and other circumstances where inline=false is faster, so the best setting may require experimentation. By default, the macro tries to guess. Currently the algorithm is simple: roughly, if there are more than two dynamically sized loops or and no convolutions, it will probably not force inlining. Otherwise, it probably will.\n\ncheck_empty (default is false) determines whether or not it will check if any of the iterators are empty. If false, you must ensure yourself that they are not empty, else the behavior of the loop is undefined and (like with @inbounds) segmentation faults are likely.\n\nunroll is an integer that specifies the loop unrolling factor, or a tuple (u₁, u₂) = (4, 2) signaling that the generated code should unroll more than one loop. u₁ is the unrolling factor for the first unrolled loop and u₂ for the next (if present), but it applies to the loop ordering and unrolling that will be chosen by LoopVectorization, not the order in body. uᵢ=0 (the default) indicates that LoopVectorization should pick its own value, and uᵢ=-1 disables unrolling for the correspond loop.\n\nThe @turbo macro also checks the array arguments using LoopVectorization.check_args to try and determine if they are compatible with the macro. If check_args returns false, a fall back loop annotated with @inbounds and @fastmath is generated. Note that VectorizationBase provides functions such as vadd and vmul that will ignore @fastmath, preserving IEEE semantics both within @turbo and @fastmath. check_args currently returns false for some wrapper types like LinearAlgebra.UpperTriangular, requiring you to use their parent.
