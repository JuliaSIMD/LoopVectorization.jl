When true, body will be directly inlined into the function (via a forced-inlining call to _avx_!). When false, it wont force inlining of the call to _avx_! instead, letting Julia's own inlining engine determine whether the call to _avx_! should be inlined. (Typically, it won't.) Sometimes not inlining can lead to substantially worse code generation, and >40% regressions, even in very large problems (2-d convolutions are a case where this has been observed). One can find some circumstances where inline=true is faster, and other circumstances where inline=false is faster, so the best setting may require experimentation. By default, the macro tries to guess. Currently the algorithm is simple: roughly, if there are more than two dynamically sized loops or and no convolutions, it will probably not force inlining. Otherwise, it probably will.\n\nunroll is an integer that specifies the loop unrolling factor, or a tuple (u₁, u₂) = (4, 2) signaling that the generated code should unroll more than one loop. u₁ is the unrolling factor for the first unrolled loop and u₂ for the next (if present), but it applies to the loop ordering and unrolling that will be chosen by LoopVectorization, not the order in body. uᵢ=0 (the default) indicates that LoopVectorization should pick its own value, and uᵢ=-1 disables unrolling for the correspond loop.\n\nThe @avx macro also checks the array arguments using LoopVectorization.check_args to try and determine if they are compatible with the macro. If check_args returns false, a fall back loop annotated with @inbounds and @fastmath is generated. Note that SIMDPirates provides functions such as evadd and evmul that will ignore @fastmath, preserving IEEE semantics both within @avx and @fastmath. check_args currently returns false for some wrapper types like LinearAlgebra.UpperTriangular, requiring you to use their parent.
