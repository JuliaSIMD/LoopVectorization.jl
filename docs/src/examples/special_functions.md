# Special Functions

`LoopVectorization` supports vectorizing many special functions, for example, to calculate the log determinant of a triangular matrix:
```julia
function logdettriangle(B::Union{LowerTriangular,UpperTriangular})
    A = parent(B) # using a triangular matrix would fall back to the default loop.
    ld = zero(eltype(A))
    @turbo for n âˆˆ axes(A,1)
        ld += log(A[n,n])
    end
    ld
end
```

While Intel's proprietary compilers do the best, LoopVectorization performs very well among open source alternatives. A complicating
factor to the above benchmark is that in accessing the diagonals, we are not accessing contiguous elements. A benchmark
simply exponentiating a vector shows that `gcc` also has efficient special function vectorization, but that the autovectorizer
disagrees with the discontiguous memory accesses:

The similar performance between `gfortran` and `LoopVectorization` at multiples of 8 is no fluke: on Linux systems with a recent GLIBC, SLEEFPirates.jl --
which LoopVectorization depends on to vectorize these special functions -- looks for the GNU vector library and uses these functions
if available. Otherwise, it will use native Julia implementations that tend to be slower. As the modulus of vector length and vector width (8, on the
host system thanks to AVX512) increases, `gfortran` shows the performance degradation pattern typical of LLVM-vectorized code.
